                          In the last couple of weeks 0pen_5pace hosted a total of four vibrant open mic
events. Three of these events took place at The Peacock in Observatory, a cosy
little bar just off the main road. They ended the show of with a last open mic
event at the famous Trench Town (for all the weed-lovers out there). These
events attracted musicians from all across the spectrum of genres who share a
love for music. As someone who is a self-proclaimed music enthusiast, these
events all shared a similar feeling of excitement and exposure to the vast talent
we have here in Cape Town.<br>
The first three events at The Peacock had a cosy and intimate feeling to them.
There weren’t too many seats, but as the night went on you could see people
sitting on the stairs or standing between the tables as they were so intrigued by
the performances. There was a range of people from all races and socio-
economic backgrounds coming together to just enjoy the music brought to us by
the local scene. The feeling of unity throughout the night was something to
cherish and a great eye-opener to know that something as simple as music could
create such a sense of oneness. Throughout the nights there were a range of
different artist performing covers as well as some of their own work. You could
expect to hear anything from rock and folk, to hip hop, rap, R&amp;B and soul –
basically anything you can imagine. What they all shared, however, was a local
vibe. There was a shared sense of knowing, between the audience members, that
this is the underground sound of Cape Town and in a larger sense South Africa.
Not denying the fact that these artists could easily compete on an international
basis – there was a great feeling of pride in being South African in these
moments.<br>
As a great end-off to these open mic events for the year 2018, the last show took
place at the exciting Trench Town. With a bit more space to entertain, it was a
great way to end the year of on a bang and accommodate a much wider
audience. The vibe was even greater than before, and you felt like you just
didn’t want the evening the end. The drinks were flowing, the artists were even
more lively than before, and those who wanted to smoke some weed to keep the
fire burning, could do just that. The crowd seemed like they were having the
time of their lives, with videos being taken of the artist’s performances and
people just jamming together to the music and having great conversation
throughout the night. As the evening came to an end, I knew that shows like
these are what shapes the Cape Town culture and South Africa as a whole.<br>
I can honestly say that I am already extremely excited for the next shows that
will be taking place in 2019. I will definitely be listening to some of the music

that the artists have in their oeuvre and hopefully be singing along more
accurately next year. These shows are already marked as “not to be missed” on
my calendar for the year. Hope to see you all there to enjoy this experience
with.
